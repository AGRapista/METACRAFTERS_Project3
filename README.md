# METACRAFTER_project3

## Description

This project was made in accordance to METACRAFTERS' online course requirements.
This simple Solidity smart contract exemplifies basic functions involving:

  - Setting up state variables
  - Reading state variables
  - Deploying smart contract
  - Interacting with smart contract

The smart contract also employs rudimentary validation controls such as:

  - Revert()
  - Require()
  - Assert()
  
## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, click on the three bars icon in the left-hand sidebar. Select "Clone" and enter the url of this github repository. Once that is finished
compile and run 'validation.sol'


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile validation.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling various functions provided with your own arguments.
